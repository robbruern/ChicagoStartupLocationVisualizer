# ChicagoStartupLocationVisualizer
TE360/401 Project:

## What?

Thesis:
Startups in Chicago will find locations for their companies, in areas were pre-existing companies in their industry already exist. 


## Why?

Interested in seeing if this correlation was different between industries
Chicago is one of the fastest growing cities in technical entrepreneurship
College startups will need locations to move to


## How?

Python libraries:
BeautifulSoup for data scraping
Bokeh Python Library (For map plotting data visualization)
All in a Jupyter Notebook


## Outcomes

Established companies gravitate towards central downtown, while startups tend to be on the outskirts
There is not much correlation between startup location and industry. The correlation varies based on industry, and is visible in some while uncorrelated in others.
Interesting see startups more central, being in more lucrative industries (Fintech, eCommerce) 

## Conclusion

While there appeared to be some correlation between emerging startup location and existing companies in the industry, there was not enough evidence to say for certain.
Industries with no tangible products donâ€™t need to worry about location.
